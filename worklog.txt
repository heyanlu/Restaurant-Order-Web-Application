// A visitor can see all menu and filter menu without login

// When he clicks add to cart on any dish, login form is offered. Logged in status makes it possible to build a cart
// Before checkout out cart, inquire online or instore
// If user chooses online, check if there is an address
// If user has address, we offer that address as default, but we also allow add a new address
// Otherwise, prompt the user to fill an address form
// After an order is placed, it can be canceled before accepted status becomes true;
// A logged in user can see orders history

Plan and test data models
Write apis and service calls
Build frontend

4.1
Made data models

4.8
Changed from ts to js
Drafted apis and service calls

4.9
Update users object. We need user id for scalability
Update other models and functions
First, get menu display and filter
Then, get login

4.10 
Make login/logout modal
Make Login modal window should not open again if user is already logged in
Make conditonally rendering pages
Refactored users logic. We can actually only rely on username to retrieve all user info

4.11
Make addToCart and getCart work
Cart is an object
Search

4.12
Made cart in backend
Moved header to app, useRef as well
Make cart in frontend
At cart page, we should be able to go back to menu
At logout, we should go back to menu pages
Header search bar should work, and put it inside the input box, using an icon such as glasses
The - + buttons should change quantity, subtotal and total. We just recalculate all

4.13
Make orders apis/services
At checkout, we should ask user whether they dine on spot or order delivery
Make profile apis/services
Make profile page
Make hamburger menu for better UI

4.14
Checkout "Your order is being processed" and return to menu after 3 seconds
Render cart button with number of items inside
Checkout should also clear cart
At refresh, address is lost
Make orders history page
If search doesn't find any items, should give a message

4.15 
At logout, reset cart state
At login, we should retrieve current cart
Make Header sticky
Removed modal window. It had to be incorporated in all components to work.
Except menu, user without sid should not be granted access to any other content. They should be directed to login
Fixed cart count error at login
Orders should be sorted in descending order
hamburger menu will close onBlur

4.16
Add all the error messages
Make dropmenu close when mouse leaves
Forbid placing orders when all cart items are zero.


Didn't do:
When choosing delivery, verify if user has a valid address
Add pagination to menu 
On refresh, the page would go back to menu instead of staying in cart if we are in cart
